# # Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer
# 
# Welcome to the second assignment of this week. In this assignment, you will learn about Neural Style Transfer. This algorithm was created by Gatys et al. (2015) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). 
# 
# **In this assignment, you will:**
# - Implement the neural style transfer algorithm 
# - Generate novel artistic images using your algorithm 
# 
# Most of the algorithms you've studied optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values. In Neural Style Transfer, you'll optimize a cost function to get pixel values!
